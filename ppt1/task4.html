        On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look
        of your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages,
        and other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate
        with your current document.
      </p>

        You can easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by choosing a look for the
        selected text from the Quick Styles gallery of the Home tab. You can also format directly by using the
        other controls on the Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look from the current theme
        or using a format that you specify directly.
      </p>

        To change the overall look of your document, choose new Theme colors or a new Theme font. To change the
        basic look of the entire document, go to the Page Layout tab. To change the Quick Styles in the Quick
        Style gallery, use the Change Current Quick Style Set command. The galleries and Quick Styles gallery
        provide quick restyling of text, and you can always revert back to the original look of your document.
